\chapter{Measurement}\label{cha:measurement}

In this chapter a description of the data collected for the model estimation is made. Each section contains a description of how each measurement was made, a list of the hardware that was used and a graph of some of the data collected. Each graph does not contain all the measured data but enough to see a pattern.
