\section{Force measurements for the end-effector} % \label{app:...}

As the Endowrist tool is highly nonlinear, measurement of how the end-effector responds to external force is made. These measurements are made for the model estimation of the EndoWrist.  

\subsection*{Purpose:}
The purpose is to define a dynamic model for the EndoWrist.

The measurements are done on three different setups:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Pull/push force for each clamp on the end-effector (yaw),
%\item Pull/push of two clamps where the force for both clamps is applied in the same direction (yaw),
\item Grip force of the clamps (yaw),
\item Down/upwards force of the pitch on the end-effector (pitch),
\item and the rotation of the end-effector (roll).
\end{itemize}

In the following subsections the different tests defined in the list above are made. For making the force measurements, item one to three, different attachment to a load-cell are made. These can be seen on \figref{fig:Overview_endowrist_attachment}.

\subsection*{Electrical circuit}
For making the force measurement for the EndoWrist a simple hardware construction was build. A simple block diagram of setup can be seen on \figref{fig:arduino_loadcell}

The load-cell's output is amplified and send to an Arduino which calculate the force applied to the load-cell. The force is then translated to a corresponding voltage output, $mV\cdot\frac{g}{4\cdot mV}$. Since the Arduino does not have a digital to analog converter (DAC), the voltage is translated to a binary code and send to a "Max531 DAC" through a serial peripheral interface (SPI). The voltage output from the DAC is read at the sbRIO board which also samples the current send to the motor, motor position and time stamps.

As explained, an Arduino is used for the translation of force applied to the load-cell. This was done since a library for the HX711 amplifier was made for the Arduino IDE\cite{Git_HX711}. This library included features such as calibration, reset and averaging of the load-cell.
